## ABOUT ME
I'm [Stanley Clark](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/stanleyclark) and you can find me using @stanrogo anywhere on the internet. Currently I am working/studying as a PhD candidate at [TU Eindhoven (TU/e)](https://www.tue.nl/en/) where I am doing a combined project within both the database and security groups. My focus is on efficient and correct enforcement of access control policies in both relational as well as graph databases.

Formerly, I completed both my Bachelor and Master degrees at the TU/e in Computer Science with a focus on Web Science. I have numerous projects collected on my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/stanrogo) page. While studying I worked as a front-end web developer for [Studyportals](https://www.studyportals.com/), a high-traffic study-search website working with Agile principles.

Besides that, I simply love trance music, playing the trombone, and of course living in the city of light that is Eindhoven. I try to take time away from the computer to read science fiction novels and enjoy learning new languages languages.
